## What is Nelly?

Nelly is an MCP server that searches your past Claude Code session transcripts (JSONL files stored in `~/.claude/projects/`) and helps you find and resume old conversations. It searches across ALL projects at once, regardless of which project you're currently working in.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g nelly-elephant-mcp
```

Add to `~/.claude/mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nelly": {
      "command": "nelly-elephant-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

- **nelly_instructions**: Returns usage guide, platform info, sessions directory status, and diagnostics
- **nelly_search**: Keyword search across all past sessions. Supports max_results (1-100), days_back (1-3650), and project filter
- **nelly_context**: Expanded context from a specific session — surrounding lines around matches
- **nelly_recent**: Lists most recent sessions by modification time. Supports count (1-100) and project filter

## Trunk Modes

- **Long Trunk**: Conversational, character-driven — Nelly guides you with personality
- **Short Trunk**: Just results. Date, project, snippet, resume command.

Say "Nelly long trunk" or "Nelly short trunk" to switch.

## Privacy

Zero network calls. Zero telemetry. Zero data collection. Reads only local JSONL files via stdio transport. One runtime dependency: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. MIT licensed.
